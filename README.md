# Technical Documentation Page

A technical documentation page about Asynchronous JavaScript built to practice creating responsive layouts.
Project is built following `user stories` by freeCodeCamp: [Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page)

## Motivation
